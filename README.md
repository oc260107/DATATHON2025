GRB Co.'s primary problem is declining revenue and eroding profitability driven by inefficiencies in its supply chain management. There are several key issues:
Delays in Shipment Scheduling: Causing missed deadlines and strained client relationships.
Misalignment Between Supply and Demand Forecasts: Leading to overstocking or stockouts, increasing costs and inefficiencies.
Suboptimal Allocation of Logistics Resources: Resulting in higher delivery costs and underutilized assets.
Our team decided to focus specifically on delays in shipment scheduling, as these have a direct impact on both operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
